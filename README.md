# Le-Bakery

This repository was made for the first phase of our final year Software Engineering mini project. The objective is to produce a software requirements specification (SRS) for a "next generation Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) system."

The repository serves as an online, shared workspace which we will also be using to aid collaboration and to manage the effort (our tool for software project management for this phase).
